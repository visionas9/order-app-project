# order-app-project
I worked on this solo project to practice everything I learned on Scrimba Javascript tutorials. 

What I Practiced:

- Rendering lists dynamically with `.map()` and `.join()`.
- Event delegation with `document.addEventListener("click", ...)`.
- Using `classList.includes()` and `dataset.id` for targeting actions.
- Managing application state with an array (`cart`).
- Creating and updating HTML with `.innerHTML`.
- Showing and hiding a modal using `display: block / none`.
- Handling form submission with the `submit` event and `preventDefault()`.
- Validating inputs with `form.checkValidity()` and `form.reportValidity()`.
- Injecting dynamic values into the DOM using template literals (`` `Thanks, ${name}!` ``).
